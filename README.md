# DoorDash Delivery Time Prediction
This repository contains the code and final paper for our group project in INFO 371: Advanced Data Science Methods at the University of Washington (Fall 2024, taught by Lovenoor Aulck). The project, completed by Paul Garces, Saimanasvi Charugundla, Ryan Nishi, and Rishita Reddy, focused on building predictive models for DoorDash delivery times.
